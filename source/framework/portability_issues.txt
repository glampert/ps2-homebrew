Some portability issues related to the PS2 and GCCv3 that I've encountered
--------------------------------------------------------------------------

- `#pragma pack` is not supported! Need to use `__attribute__((packed))`.

- `std::vsnprintf` is not available on namespace std. Have to use just `vsnprintf`.

- No <cstdint> (neither <stdint.h>).

- No way of specifying (that I know of) the calling convention of a function.
  So C++ class method will always be "this_call"? That would break any format functions
  defined as class members (format funcs require "cdecl"). *This was NOT confirmed!*

- No `HUGE_VAL` implemented (will compile but fail to link!).

- No `double` precision (using double compiles but defaults to float).

- All math functions are suffixed with `f`. E.g.: sqrtf, atanf, sinf, etc...
  (because there is no double precision, so only the float ones are available).

- My tricky `arrayLength(T)` template function doesn't seem to work
  with explicitly `static` arrays. GCC bug???

- Minimal Standard C library. Did not test the STL, but the header only
  classes should work more or less...
